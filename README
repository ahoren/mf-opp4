A port of mobility-fw2.0p3 for OMNeT++ 4.0 simulator
====================================================
by Jerome Rousselot <jerome.rousselot@csem.ch> and Rudolf Hornig <rudi@omnetpp.org>

This is an unofficial (not supported by its original authors) port of the 
Mobility Framework 2.0p3 to OMNeT++ 4.0.

Its latest version can be found at github.com:
http://github.com/mobility-fw/mf-opp4/tree/master

and some information is available at the wiki page:
http://wiki.github.com/mobility-fw/mf-opp4

Two branches are available: master and ext.

master is a "pure" port of mf2.

ext includes additional modules from other authors. Contributions and bug fixes are welcome.
An example network was added in networks/ieee802154 to demonstrate the use of the
high precision multiple access interference PHY SnrEvalRadioAccNoise3, the CSMA protocol
as defined in IEEE 802.15.4 (csma.ned) and the WiseRoute routing layer (wiseroute.ned).

Several modules in the ext branch have been partially financed by the European Commission 
under the Framework 6 IST Project ‚ÄùWirelessly Accessible Sensor Populations" (WASP) 
under contract IST-034963.

To run examples in the "networks" folder. Use the "run" script in the example dirs
Note that the "networks", folder does not contain any .cc files so it is not added to the makefiles.

Changes
-------
In contrib, the P2PLayer does not use the sendDirect method anymore.
The core/include and contrib/include directories have been removed, as well as
the core/lib and contrib/lib directories, to simplify the build process.
The libraries are now in core/libmfcore.so and in contrib/libmfcontrib.so.

Purpose
=======
The mobility framework provides abstractions needed to develop network
protocols for non-stationary wireless nodes. 


Requirements
============
This version of the Mobility Framework requires OMNeT++ 4.0 or higher.
The only platform it has been tested on is Linux (2.6.xx kernel, g++ 4.3.x).

Installation 
============
1. Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
   tar xzf mobility-fw<VERSION>.tgz

2. run the mkmk shell script
   ./mkmk

3. make all 


Importing the project into the OMNeT++ 4 IDE
============================================
After starting the OMNeT++ IDE, you can import the project by right-clicking
in the project list and choosing the "Import..." wizard, and 
"General->Existing project into Workspace".  Select the directory containing 
the branch as root directory. You should be able to build it by pressing CTRL-B. 


Getting started
===============
 
This will "install" the library in the lib directories and the
include files in the include directories of the MF.

To see if it runs, try the networks in the networks directory.
Select or open an inifile and press the Run button in the IDE.

Copy the template from the template directory to a directory of
your choice -- it has its own INSTALL instructions to get you
started quickly with your own simulation. NOTE: The template 
directory is not fully adapted to MF 2.0. So not all the stuff
will work!


Release notes
=============
* 2.0p3 for OMNeT++ 4
The same version for OMNeT++ 4 converted by Jerome Rousselot 
<jerome.rousselot@csem.ch> and Rudolf Hornig <rudi@omnetpp.org>
Changes: In contrib, the P2PLayer does not use the sendDirect method anymore.
The core/include and contrib/include directories have been removed, as well as
the core/lib and contrib/lib directories, to simplify the build process.
The libraries are now in core/libmfcore.so and in contrib/libmfcontrib.so.

* 2.0p3
just another preview. Basically just contains several 802.11 bug fixes.
Re-added old manual of MF v1

* 2.0p2:
Preview no.2. Main enhancements (apart from some minor bug fixes) are:
- windows make system should work know. See the install directions for 
  details
- MAC OS make system added. MF can be installed on MAC OS either with or 
  without shared libraries. NOT TESTED!
- 802.11 should work again - at least with the basic bitrate. However,
  the automatic bitrate adaption still crashes.
- We started to adapt the template folder to MF 2.0 - not finished yet!

* 2.0p1:
Preview of a MF with major restructuring and redesign. As with previews there
may still be bugs and not everything has been thorouly tested yet. Especially 
the 802.11 network still CRASHES! The manual has not been updated yet, please 
use the doxygen documentation for detailed information.
Key changes include:
- enhanced efficiency of the code (speed and memory consumption), up to 
  thousands of nodes can now be simulated on standard PCs
  - added sendDirect option (less gates -> less memory)
  - added grid to channel control to speed up connection management
- more user implementation flexibility
  - reduced core MF (only contains basic mobility, channel control and modules
    up to the MAC)
  - cleaner possibility to add / modify control infos to messages
  - moved radio related stuff into a seperate radio module
  - added arp functionality
- completely redesigned blackboard
  - only publisher can change published items
  - items are identified by their class instead of strings (speed!)
  - items can be subclassed and extended
- better mobility support
  - complete border handling implemented
  - supported policies are: reflect, wrap, place randomly and raise error
- bug fixes
  - several bugs removed from aloha, csma and snr-eval modules
  - started to debug 802.11 - NOT FINISHED yet!
